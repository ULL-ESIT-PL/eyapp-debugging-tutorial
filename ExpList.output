Rules:
------

1:	S -> S x
2:	S -> x
3:	x -> NUM
4:	x -> x OP NUM

States:
-------
State 0:

	$start -> . S $end	(Rule 0)

	NUM	shift, and go to state 1

	S	go to state 2
	x	go to state 3

State 1:

	x -> NUM .	(Rule 3)

	$default	reduce using rule 3 (x)

State 2:

	$start -> S . $end	(Rule 0)
	S -> S . x	(Rule 1)

	$end	shift, and go to state 4
	NUM	shift, and go to state 1

	x	go to state 5

State 3:

	S -> x .	(Rule 2)
	x -> x . OP NUM	(Rule 4)

	OP	shift, and go to state 6

	$end	reduce using rule 2 (S)
	NUM	reduce using rule 2 (S)

State 4:

	$start -> S $end .	(Rule 0)

	$default	accept

State 5:

	S -> S x .	(Rule 1)
	x -> x . OP NUM	(Rule 4)

	OP	shift, and go to state 6

	$end	reduce using rule 1 (S)
	NUM	reduce using rule 1 (S)

State 6:

	x -> x OP . NUM	(Rule 4)

	NUM	shift, and go to state 7
